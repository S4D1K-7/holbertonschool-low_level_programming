There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
'Til school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it
Oh my God, I got excited, and I forgot to let them sing
You guys wanna sing the song, right?
(Yeah)
Oh, it'll be good for the video thing
It'll be that whatever it is we're recording tonight, yeah
Let's just call it the experience
There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
'Til school comes along just to end it
So (the annual problem for our generation)
(Is finding a good way to spend it)
Let me be
Building a rocket or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving our sister insane
Seekers, stop it 'til the four school starts this fall
Zip it that's cause fitty as a bob I'm gonna do it all
Zip it that's cause fitty as a bob I'm gonna do it all
Good job
